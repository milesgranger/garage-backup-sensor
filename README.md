# garage-backup-sensor

Hobby IoT project using an 
[STM32U575ZITx Nucleo development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-u575zi-q.html#overview).
Paired with a 
[Parallax laser distance sensor](https://no.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Parallax/28041?qs=W0yvOO0ixfFec%252BrQlZCaZw%3D%3D&countryCode=NO&currencyCode=NOK) 
and some basic LEDs from a previous Pico dev kit, notifying when to stop backing 
up in order to maximize the area behind the car and without the garage door hitting 
it on the way down. :)
